Programming challenge for potential candidates

You will be developing a new site for clinicians to access images produced by the Instapath imaging system. As a first step you will need to develop a responsive navbar with login/logout and user authentication. A barebones `index.html` file is provided, or you may create your own project.

User: `jdoe` Password: `password` should be able to login successfully with all other permutations of usernames and passwords failing, with a notification. 

## Requirements:
* Demonstrate use of web standards including HTML5.
* Make the navbar responsive with at least one breakpoint (your choice as to how it looks on a smaller screen width).
* Use JavaScript to control whether the login or the logout button is shown; only one should be visible at a time.

## Notes 
You may use SASS, LESS, PostCSS, etc to pre-compile your CSS.

## Styling Suggestions
These are loose guidelines and you may feel free to customize as you feel is appropriate.

* Use the "Roboto" Google font

Use the following colors
* Page background: #FFFFFF
* Default/normal font color: #494949
* Navbar background: #14C3F4

## Submitting
Please create a zip file containing

Any source code files needed to run your program

A README.md explaining:

1) Any steps necessary to run your program
2) Approximately how long you spent (this is not timed, but itâ€™s helpful for us)
3) Any additional comments

You can write your program in any language you like as long as we can run it on a POSIX compliant OS (Linux or OSX preferred).

## FAQ
### Is it OK to share your solutions publicly? 
Yes, the questions are not prescriptive, the process and discussion around the code is the valuable part. You do the work, you own the code. Given we are asking you to give up your time, it is entirely reasonable for you to keep and use your solution as you see fit.

### Should I do X? 
For any value of X, it is up to you, we intentionally leave the problem a little open-ended and will leave it up to you to provide us with what you see as important. Just remember the rough time frame of the project. If it is going to take you a more than a few hours, it isn't essential.

### Something is ambiguous, and I don't know what to do? 
The first thing is: don't get stuck. We really don't want to trip you up intentionally, we are just attempting to see how you approach problems. That said, there are intentional ambiguities in the specifications, mainly to see how you fill in those gaps, and how you make design choices. If you really feel stuck, our first preference is for you to make a decision and document it with your submission - in this case there is really no wrong answer. If you feel it is not possible to do this, just send us an email and we will try to clarify or correct the question for you.
