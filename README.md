Programming challenge for potential candidates

## Submitting
Please create a zip file containing

Any source code files needed to run your program

A README.md explaining:

1) Any steps necessary to run your program
2) Approximately how long you spent (this is not timed, but itâ€™s helpful for us)
3) Any additional comments

You can write your program in any language you like as long as we can run it on a POSIX compliant OS (Linux or OSX preferred).

## FAQ
### Is it OK to share your solutions publicly? 
Yes, the questions are not prescriptive, the process and discussion around the code is the valuable part. You do the work, you own the code. Given we are asking you to give up your time, it is entirely reasonable for you to keep and use your solution as you see fit.

### Should I do X? 
For any value of X, it is up to you, we intentionally leave the problem a little open-ended and will leave it up to you to provide us with what you see as important. Just remember the rough time frame of the project. If it is going to take you a couple of days, it isn't essential.

### Something is ambiguous, and I don't know what to do? 
The first thing is: don't get stuck. We really don't want to trip you up intentionally, we are just attempting to see how you approach problems. That said, there are intentional ambiguities in the specifications, mainly to see how you fill in those gaps, and how you make design choices. If you really feel stuck, our first preference is for you to make a decision and document it with your submission - in this case there is really no wrong answer. If you feel it is not possible to do this, just send us an email and we will try to clarify or correct the question for you.
